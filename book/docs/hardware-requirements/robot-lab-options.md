# Robot Lab Options

## Overview

This guide presents different approaches for setting up a robot laboratory to support the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.

## Option 1: Individual Student Kits

### Description
Each student receives a personal Physical AI Edge Kit for hands-on learning.

### Components per Student
- Physical AI Edge Kit (as detailed separately)
- Small robotic platform (TurtleBot3 or similar)
- Basic tools and accessories

### Cost Estimate
- Per student: ~$1,500
- For 30 students: ~$45,000

### Advantages
- Maximum hands-on time for each student
- Ability to work outside lab hours
- Personal ownership of learning platform

### Disadvantages
- High initial cost
- Management of individual equipment
- Potential for loss/damage

## Option 2: Shared Lab Stations

### Description
Dedicated workstations in a laboratory setting with shared equipment.

### Components per Station
- Digital Twin Workstation (high-performance)
- Multiple robotic platforms
- Shared sensors and components
- Testing arena

### Cost Estimate
- Per station: ~$5,000
- For 10 stations: ~$50,000

### Advantages
- Lower per-unit cost
- Centralized management
- Access to higher-end equipment
- Collaborative learning environment

### Disadvantages
- Limited availability during peak times
- Less individual hands-on time
- Scheduling requirements

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach

### Description
Combination of basic personal kits with shared advanced equipment.

### Components
- Personal: Basic Raspberry Pi-based kits (~$200)
- Shared: High-performance stations and advanced robots
- Cloud access for intensive computation

### Cost Estimate
- Per student: ~$500
- Shared equipment: ~$20,000
- For 30 students: ~$35,000

### Advantages
- Balanced cost and accessibility
- Scalable approach
- Flexible learning options

### Disadvantages
- Complex management
- Requires cloud infrastructure
- Mixed capability levels

## Recommendation

For optimal learning outcomes, we recommend the **Hybrid Approach** as it provides:
- Affordable access for all students
- Advanced equipment for complex projects
- Flexibility for different learning styles
- Sustainable long-term operation
