# Week 11-12: Humanoid Robot Development

## Overview

This week focuses on developing humanoid robots that can interact with human environments and perform complex tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Understand humanoid robot design principles
- Implement bipedal locomotion algorithms
- Design human-robot interaction systems
- Integrate multiple robotic subsystems

## Content

### Humanoid Robot Design

Humanoid robots are designed to operate in human environments, requiring:

- Bipedal locomotion systems
- Human-scale manipulation capabilities
- Natural interaction modalities
- Safety systems for human proximity

### Key Challenges

Developing humanoid robots presents unique challenges:

- Balance and stability during locomotion
- Complex kinematics and dynamics
- Real-time control of many degrees of freedom
- Human-safe operation
