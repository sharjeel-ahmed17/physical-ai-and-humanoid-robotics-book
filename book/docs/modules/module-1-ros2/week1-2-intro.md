# Week 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI

## Overview

This week introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Define Physical AI and distinguish it from traditional AI
- Understand the importance of physical laws in AI systems
- Identify key challenges in Physical AI implementation

## Content

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI systems that operate primarily in digital spaces to AI systems that must function effectively in the physical world. Unlike conventional AI that processes abstract data, Physical AI systems must understand and interact with the physical environment, respecting constraints such as:

- Conservation of energy and momentum
- Material properties and limitations
- Real-time physical interactions
- Safety and reliability requirements

### Key Differences from Traditional AI

| Traditional AI | Physical AI |
|----------------|-------------|
| Operates in digital/virtual environments | Interacts with physical world |
| Low-stakes errors | High-stakes consequences |
| Fast iteration possible | Physical constraints limit testing |
| Deterministic data | Noisy, uncertain sensor data |
