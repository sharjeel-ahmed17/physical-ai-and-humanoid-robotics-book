# Week 3-5: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview

This section covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware and framework for building robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Understand ROS 2 architecture and concepts
- Create basic ROS 2 nodes and topics
- Implement services and actions
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging and visualization

## Content

### ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 uses a distributed architecture based on the Data Distribution Service (DDS) for communication between nodes. Key concepts include:

- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication
