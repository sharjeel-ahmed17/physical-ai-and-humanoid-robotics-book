# Data Model: User Authentication with Background Profiling

## User Profile Entity

### Core Attributes
- **id**: string (unique identifier, generated by system)
- **email**: string (user's email address, unique, validated)
- **password_hash**: string (hashed password, stored securely by Better Auth)
- **created_at**: timestamp (account creation time)
- **updated_at**: timestamp (last profile update time)

### Software Background Attributes
- **software_experience**: string[] (array of programming languages, frameworks, tools)
- **years_coding**: number (years of software development experience)
- **primary_languages**: string[] (primary programming languages used)
- **development_area**: string (web, mobile, backend, frontend, AI/ML, etc.)

### Hardware Background Attributes
- **hardware_familiarity**: string[] (robotics platforms, hardware components, sensors)
- **years_hardware**: number (years of hardware experience)
- **preferred_platforms**: string[] (ROS, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- **robotics_experience**: string (none, basic, intermediate, advanced)

### Derived Attributes
- **skill_level**: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced" (computed from background data)
- **interests**: string[] (derived from background data for personalization)
- **learning_path**: string (recommended learning path based on background)

## Authentication Session Entity

### Attributes
- **session_id**: string (unique session identifier)
- **user_id**: string (reference to user profile)
- **created_at**: timestamp (session creation time)
- **expires_at**: timestamp (session expiration time)
- **ip_address**: string (user's IP address for security)
- **user_agent**: string (browser/device information)

## Validation Rules

### User Profile Validation
- Email must be valid format and unique
- Password must meet security requirements (min 8 chars, mixed case, numbers)
- software_experience: min 1 item, max 10 items, each 2-50 chars
- hardware_familiarity: min 0 items, max 10 items, each 2-50 chars
- years_coding: 0-50 range
- years_hardware: 0-50 range
- skill_level: must be one of the three allowed values

### Security Validation
- All inputs must be sanitized to prevent injection
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Secure session tokens with proper encryption

## State Transitions

### User Profile States
- **Pending**: After registration, before profile completion
- **Active**: After successful registration and profile completion
- **Suspended**: If account is temporarily disabled
- **Deactivated**: If user requests account deletion

### Session States
- **Active**: Valid session with authenticated user
- **Expired**: Session has timed out
- **Revoked**: Session invalidated by user or system

## Relationships
- One User Profile to Many Authentication Sessions (one-to-many)
- User Profile is extended from Better Auth's base User model
