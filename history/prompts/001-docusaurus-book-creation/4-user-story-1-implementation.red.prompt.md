## Prompt

Phase 3: User Story 1 - Access Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

## Response snapshot

## Implementation Completed: Phase 3 - User Story 1

I have successfully completed Phase 3: User Story 1 - Access Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

### Phase 3: User Story 1 - Access Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook - COMPLETED
- [X] T009: Created accessibility test for textbook content in tests/accessibility/test-textbook-content.js
- [X] T010: Created content rendering test in tests/e2e/test-content-rendering.js
- [X] T011: Created intro.md file with course overview in docs/intro.md
- [X] T012: Created module-1-ros2 directory and initial content in docs/modules/module-1-ros2/
- [X] T013: Created module-2-digital-twin directory and initial content in docs/modules/module-2-digital-twin/
- [X] T014: Created module-3-ai-robot-brain directory and initial content in docs/modules/module-3-ai-robot-brain/
- [X] T015: Created module-4-vla directory and initial content in docs/modules/module-4-vla/
- [X] T016: Implemented basic textbook navigation in sidebars.js
- [X] T017: Added basic content to week1-2-intro.md in docs/modules/module-1-ros2/week1-2-intro.md
- [X] T018: Added basic content to week3-5-ros2-fundamentals.md in docs/modules/module-1-ros2/week3-5-ros2-fundamentals.md

### Key Accomplishments:

1. **Test Implementation**:
   - Created accessibility test suite to ensure content meets accessibility standards
   - Created end-to-end content rendering tests to verify proper display of textbook content

2. **Complete Textbook Structure**:
   - All 4 modules with their respective content have been created
   - Week-by-week breakdown following the 13-week curriculum
   - Proper navigation structure implemented

3. **Content Completeness**:
   - Introduction page with course overview
   - Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Weeks 1-5
   - Module 2: Digital Twin & Simulation - Weeks 6-7
   - Module 3: AI-Robot Brain - Weeks 8-10
   - Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models - Weeks 11-13
   - Hardware requirements section with detailed specifications

4. **Navigation**:
   - Full navigation structure implemented in sidebars.js
   - Proper categorization by modules with week-based content
   - Autogenerated navigation for each module directory

User Story 1 is now fully functional and testable independently. Students and educators can access the comprehensive textbook content on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics with proper navigation and accessibility features.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully completed User Story 1 implementation, enabling students and educators to access the comprehensive textbook content on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- 🧪 Tests: Created 2 test files (accessibility and content rendering tests)
- 📁 Files: Updated tasks.md and created test files in the book directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with User Story 2 implementation (Phase 4)
- 🧠 Reflection: All tasks for User Story 1 have been completed successfully, with proper testing and navigation structure in place

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All required tasks completed successfully
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin with Phase 4 User Story 2 implementation
